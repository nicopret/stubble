Create a restify service with mock data from a swagger contract.

Add your swagger files to config.json -> files for the type of server you want to implement.

Just run:

    npm server


Navigate to the output folder specified in the config file and start the server with: node index.js

Still loads of stuff to be finished, but should create a server on a well-formed contract. Only caters for json data at this stage.
